            NYC based singer and actor Sarah Ruth Mikulski grew up taking dance
            class, singing “Mary Had a Little Lamb” on car rides, and watching
            Julie Andrews movies on repeat. She fell in love with Mary Poppins
            and Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals and knew she was bound for the
            stage! She studied vocal performance at Western Michigan University
            in Kalamazoo, MI where she received her Bachelor of Music. Sarah
            moved to New York City and earned her Master of Music in Vocal
            Performance at the Manhattan School of Music. Sarah Ruth has
            performed with several musical theatre and opera companies including
            White Plains Performing Arts Center, Opera Grand Rapids, Cedar
            Rapids Opera Theatre, Shoreline Theatrical Arts (Guilford, CT),
            Parallel 45 Theatre (Traverse City, MI), College Light Opera Company
            (Falmouth, MA), Pride Arts (Chicago, IL), Folks Operetta (Chicago,
            IL), and The Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company (Chicago, IL). She
            is on a quest to find the best chocolate cake in the world
            (suggestions welcome!) and has a hard time walking by any bakery
            without stopping for a treat. If anyone knows of jobs that include
            endless dessert tastings, let her know!
