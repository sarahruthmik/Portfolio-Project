          “A recent transplant to the Chicago area, Sarah Ruth Mikulski is a
          real find. As The Sister, she has the most beautiful, crystal clear
          soprano ever heard in this theatre, and this role is bound to be the
          beginning of a successful musical career in the Windy City.”

          has the singing voice of an angel.""

          “It was no wonder that Sarah Ruth Mikulski, being seductively attired,
          stole the show as well as the hearts of the jurymen and the judge. Her
          stage presence and vocal ability were quite good.”

          “Soprano Sarah Mikulski made a most effective Blonde both dramatically
          and vocally; we enjoyed her sparring with Osmin.”
